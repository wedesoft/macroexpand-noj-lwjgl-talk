# Computer Graphics with Clojure, LWJGL, and Fastmath

*Upcoming talk at Macroexpand-Noj, October 17-18, 2025*

## Abstract
sfsim is a space flight simulator under development.
It makes use of Clojure, LWJGL, and Fastmath among other libraries.
More than half of the code deals with graphics.
This talk gives a short introduction using LWJGL's OpenGL bindings to get started with rendering data from NASA's CGI Moon Kit.

## Bio
Jan studied compiler construction and robotics and later did a PhD in computer vision.
He currently works in industry developing inspection software.
His first programming languages were Omikron Basic and later Borland Pascal.
In industry he used C++, Ruby, and Python.
In his spare time he got interested in Ruby, GNU Guile, and finally Clojure.
